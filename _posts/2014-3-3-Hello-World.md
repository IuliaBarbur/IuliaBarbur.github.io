Outside of my growing interest in the various video games my older brother cycled through, I grew up with a pretty average relationship with technology. As a sophomore studying engineering I enrolled in a 100-level Java course to satisfy a technical elective. At the time, I used my windows desktop computer in my dorm to do a majority of my work, with a chromebook for note taking and browsing around campus. One fateful day just before my final project was due, my motherboard sighed its last breath, and I was left effectively without a usable computer. In a panic, I called my older brother, and ....

Enter: the Acer 270 Chromebook running arch linux. Cause that's the most it could run. My first linux experience would be one in which I'd have to run a tight ship: I had never rationed my tabs before. Listening to a video on YouTube in the background while working on an assignment? That life of luxury was now in the past.
