title: How do I do this again?

A former programmer's journey back to knowing what the heck is going on re: all things technical.

Outside of my growing interest in the various video games my older brother cycled through, I grew up with a pretty average relationship with technology. As a sophomore studying engineering I enrolled in a 100-level Java course to satisfy a technical elective. At the time, I used my Windows desktop computer in my dorm to do a majority of my work, with a Chromebook for note taking and browsing around campus. One fateful day just before my final project was due, the motherboard in my desktop sighed its last breath, and I was left without an effective computer. In a panic, I called my older brother, and ....

Enter: his spare Acer 270 Chromebook running Arch Linux. Cause that's the most it could run. My first Linux experience would be one in which I'd have to run a tight ship entirely by myself: I had never heard of a command line before, let alone rationed my tabs. Listening to a video on YouTube in the background while working on an assignment? That life of luxury was now in the past. Even if I figured out how to install the required packages to make the audio work in the first place.

In the many years since then, I both gained and lost the majority of my technical skills. My current goals aren't crazy: I just want to be able to maintain a linux install as my daily driver with some shred of confidence. Building back a technical skillset that enables me to think of solutions to problems in my daily life as a physician at work / human being at home and having fun would be cool bonuses.
